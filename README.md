## Project: Traffic Sign Classifier CNN
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---

A convolutional neural network that classifies traffic signs with 95% accuracy.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Running to code
The easiest way to run the Jupyter notebook is by using [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)

Run the following to get started, this downloads a Docker container with all the required dependencies

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v `pwd`:/src udacity/carnd-term1-starter-kit
```

A link with an access token should be outputed to the console.
